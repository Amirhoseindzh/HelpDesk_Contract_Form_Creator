## Introduction
During my internship in a helpdesk position, I noticed that repair technicians needed a software solution to easily create contract forms while saving the date and time automatically. This inspired me to start a project using Python and the custom-tkinter library to develop a simple and efficient software tool. The result is a user-friendly application that meets these needs. I hope you enjoy it! :)
